                <p>e Jobs didn't give the WWDC keynote on June 8, 2009. He was away on medical leave. So, a team of Apple executives soldiered on without him. That included Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, who's task was to fill the biggest New Balances in the business for what was becoming Apple's biggest business. Schiller started off quoting Time Magazine's praise for "the phone that has changed phones forever." He'd go on to make that phone more affordable that ever, while also introducing its successor. It boasted twice the speed, both for processing and data networking. It was the iPhone 3GS.</p>

                    James Simpson was born in Bathgate a younger son of Mary Jervais and David Simpson, a baker. He attended the local school, and in 1825, at the age of 14, entered the University of Edinburgh to study for an arts degree.[3] Two years later he began his medical studies at the University,[3] graduating with an MBChB. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1830[3] and received his MD in 1832.[4] While at University he took additional classes including those delivered by the surgeon Robert Liston. As a result of the quality of his MD thesis on inflammation, Professor of Pathology John Thomson took him on as his assistant.[5]

                    As a student he became a member and then Senior President of the Royal Medical Society, initiating a lifelong interest in the Society's advancement.[6]

                    His first role was as a general practitioner in the Stockbridge district based at 2 Deanhaugh Street.[7]

                    At the age of 28, he succeeded James Hamilton as Professor of Medicine and Midwifery at the University of Edinburgh.[8]

                    He kept a town house at 52 Queen Street, Edinburgh and a country house near Bathgate

                <p>The vocal range of the tenor is one of the highest of the male voice types. Within opera, the lowest note in the standard tenor repertoire is probably[weasel words] A♭2 in Rossini's rarely performed La donna del lago in the role of Rodrigo di Dhu, written for Andrea Nozzari. Within more frequently performed repertoire, Mime and Herod both call for an A2. A few tenor roles in the standard repertoire call for a "tenor C" (C5, one octave above middle C). Some, if not all, of the few top Cs in the standard operatic repertoire are either optional—such as in "Che gelida manina" in Puccini's La bohème—or interpolated (added) by tradition, such as in "Di quella pira" from Verdi's Il trovatore);[citation needed] however, the highest demanded note in the standard tenor operatic repertoire is D5, found in "Mes amis, écoutez l'histoire"[5] from Adolphe Adam's Le postillon de Lonjumeau and "Loin de son amie"[6] from Fromental Halévy's La Juive). In the leggero repertoire, the highest note is F5 (Arturo in "Credeasi, misera" from Bellini's I puritani),[7][original research?] therefore, very few tenors have this role in their repertoire without transposition (given the raising of concert pitch since its composition),[8][page needed] or resorting to falsetto.</p>

                    Le comte Ory is a comic opera written by Gioachino Rossini in 1828. Some of the music originates from his opera Il viaggio a Reims written three years earlier for the coronation of Charles X.[1] The French libretto was by Eugène Scribe and Charles-Gaspard Delestre-Poirson adapted from a comedy they had first written in 1817.

                    The work is ostensibly a comic opera in that the story is humorous, even farcical. However, it was devised for the Opéra rather than for the Théâtre de l'Opéra-Comique and there are structural inconsistencies with the contemporary opéra comique genre: whereas the latter consists of relatively short lyrical numbers and spoken dialogue, Le comte Ory consists of "highly developed, even massive musical forms linked by accompanied recitative".[2] Although the opera contains some of Rossini's most colorful orchestral writing, the quaint, brief overture is oddly restrained and unassuming, ending with a whisper of pizzicato strings.
